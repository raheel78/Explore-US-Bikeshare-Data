Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data
Version: 1.0
Submission: First time - 12 March 2018
Design and code by:  Raheel Khan (Udacity Classroom Mentor and DLND Project Reviewer)
Filename: readme.txt

Some important considerations for the reviewer of this project as follows:

1. I am doing classroom mentoring at Udacity for BAND, DAND and DLNF programs and have seen, advise and guide students on project.
2. My submitted code is a combination of my own code, advise from fellow mentors forum, reviews and mentoring of DAND students in last 7 months.
3. Reviewer might find some part of this code which is very similar to other students, 
reason being is that helper/utility functions are almost similar.

4. I did not revisit every single line of functions which are straight forward in function, such as; get_users() and get_month() etc.
